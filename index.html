                <p>Photography allows me to capture moments that would otherwise fade with time, preserving memories for people to look back on and relive. I love the idea of freezing emotions, places, and experiences in a single frame, creating a visual history that can be cherished for years.<br><br>Whether it’s a fleeting smile, a special event, or a familiar place that holds meaning, my goal is to tell stories through my photos—stories that bring back feelings, spark nostalgia, and keep memories alive.</p>
